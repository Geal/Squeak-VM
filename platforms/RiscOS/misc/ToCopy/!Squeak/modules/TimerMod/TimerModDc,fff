Timer Module
===== ======

© 1991-2002 DEEJ Technology PLC

Provides SWI's and *commands for use in timing programs.
SWI chunk base &490C0 (Acorn Registered).

SWI "Timer_Start"       Turns timer on.
SWI "Timer_Stop"        Returns time interval between last Timer Start,
                        may be called many times.
                        R0 = time in seconds
                        R1 = remainder in microseconds
SWI "Timer_Value"       Returns monotonic time in seconds and microseconds.
                        R0 = time in seconds
                        R1 = remainder in microseconds

*TimerStart             Equivalent to SWI "Timer_Start"
*TimerStop              Stops timer and prints time elapsed message.
*TimerValue             Prints monotonic time to microsecond resolution.
*TimedOS                Creates GOS type command shell and times all
                        commands given until a *QUIT, (remember Arthur OS?)


==> Help on keyword TimerMod
Module is: Timer Module    4.10 (02 Jan 2003) [32bit]

Commands provided:
TimerStart      TimerStop       TimerValue      TimedOS

It has help on:
TimerMod

==> Help on keyword TimerStart
*TimerStart starts the Timer module interval timer, cancelling any previous TimerStart.
Syntax: *TimerStart


==> Help on keyword TimerStop
*TimerStop stops the Timer module interval timer, printing the time elapsed since the last TimerStart.
Syntax: *TimerStop


==> Help on keyword TimerValue
*TimerValue prints the system monotonic time to microsecond resolution.
Syntax: *TimerValue


Technical Information
---------------------

On all machines the module uses the CMOS clock for time calculations to
1 centisecond resolution. Microsecond resolution is provided by hardware
specific timers. On Risc PC, A7000 and Archimedes machines the 2MHz 
IOMD/IOC timer 0 is used. On RISC OS 5 machines the HAL counter 0 is
read, which on the Iyonix is provided by the XScale 80321 and runs at 200MHz.
