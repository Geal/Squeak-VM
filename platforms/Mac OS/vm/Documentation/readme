Building a Carbon Squeak VM with XCode:

{JMM notes this is building with 10.4.x, and Squeak 3.9 (for croquet & Tweak)}
{JMM notes the OLD browser plugin was fully broken with changes to the code for 3.8.12, likely you need to pull a 3.8.11 or 3.8.10 version to make that old browser plugin for os-x 10.0, 10.1 and 10.2}
{JMM notes read on for notes about the new browser plugin}


Step One: Get the Apple Developer Tools (free)

	The current build requires the latest XCode tools.  They are available to Online members at the apple developer website.  You can get an Online membership for free at:

		http://developer.apple.com/membership/online.html
		
		(Note building with GCC 3.3 PowerPC produces better code than gcc 4.0, gcc 3.1 or gcc 2.95, FYI gcc 3.1 produces lousy code). 
		Of course you must build with GCC 4.x for MacIntel, but the XCode project does this automatically for you
				
Step Two: Get the current SVN Platforms tree

	A.	Visit http://subversion.tigris.org/ to understand SVN, and I suspect install SVN on your machine.
		You should visit
			http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/download/
		to get the client gui. Checkout a working copy of the squeak/trunk, either via the GUI tool
		where you select the version you want to check out and hit the svn checkout button, then when prompted
		point to your build folder.  

		or from a terminal session go to the directory you want to build in, say your vmmaker image folder, 
		then enter svn co http://squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/trunk svnSqueakTree.

		I will note which version of the tree you check out is dependent on which version of the mac carbon VM you want to build
		you should check the tree version numbers and comments to identify the point in the versions where one version of 
		the VM ends and a new version starts. 

		
After so much mumbo-jumbo, your Squeak folder should have a directory entitled platforms.

Step Three: Build an interpeter

	0.  Grab your 3.8 image (6665 was last trial patch level tested). Using a basic image versus a full image might be faster. 
	3.8.1 might work too, since most logic is in VMMaker not the image. 
	3.9 *has* been used occasionally but most VM building has occurred in a 3.8 image.
 
	Install Balloon 3D, then install FFI if you are using a 3.9 image.


	Finally install version 3.8b6 of VMMaker, from
	http://map.squeak.org/accountbyid/4340a66e-2296-48b7-9aa8-5305d303752f/files/VMMaker-3.8b6.mcz
	or later...

	When this loads reply yes to move FloatProto to Undeclared if you did not use the basic image. {This prompt does not occur in a 3.9 image}
	Now load the following three change sets found in the specialChangeSets folder.
	Note these might be in the VMMaker update since this doc was written, check the change set and 
	the image after loading VMMaker to see if you need these items. {In a 3.9 7067 image the first two change sets appear NOT to be needed.}

	load VMM38-gc-instrument-image.1.cs 
	load VMM38-64bit-imageUpdates.1.cs
	load JMM-fixBiasToGrow.1.cs.zip  (may be in VMMaker some day, please ensure it is there)
	load bigCursor-bf.1.cs  (larger cursor support, may be in VMMaker some day)

	That should provide a version of VMMaker that is sufficient to build 3.8.17b2 (or later)

	OPTIONAL Expury if you want Expury support.

	File in Exupery-wbk.195 from Exupery site and VMMaker-wbk.40.8.cs or higher change set from the specialChangeSets Folder 
	(VMMaker-wbk.40.8.cs is the differences between VMMaker-wbk.40 and VMMaker 3.8b6). Please note these changes might be folded
	 into a later release of VMMaker-wbk, please check. Also then you must add the exupery plugin to the list of internal plugins. 

	
	A.  Install additional change sets from the specialChangeSets Folder. 
		There has been some discussion that the line endings 
		might be wrong for the following change sets that might depend on what CVS/SVN thinks, 
		so do a "remove linefeeds" first. 
		
		Gnuifier.8.cs - A smalltalk version of the AWK example. 	
		ArraysToGlobalStruct-JMM.1.cs  - Put arrays in the structure, this fixes some issues with 'global code elimination' in the compiler.
		
	B.	DoIt: VMMakerTool openInWorld  (Ensure you have the latest VMMaker, do an SqueakMap update if unsure, see Step 3 above)
	C.	Enter the Path to platforms code: (enter path to platforms in step two).
	D.	Enter the Platform name: (default is fine) "Mac OS"
	E.	Enter the Path for your generates sources (note src32 should be renamed to src to make XCode happy). 
	E2. 	Note mac carbon VM only supports a 32 bit VM since the entire carbon/osx api set is 32bit, not 64. 
	F.	Select plugins. (Suggest selecting menu item "make all internal",
		then drag back the following back to Plugins not built:
			FFIPlugin
			FileCopyPlugin
			Mpeg3Plugin
			TestOSAPlugin
			PrintJobPlugin (if installed, we'll discuss how to built this later)
	G.	Press button "Save Configuration" to save your configuration for later.
	H.	Press button "Generate All" to build the interpreter, it then builds a source tree in a folder called src or src32


Step Four: Get, and install, the Gnifier, and gnuify the interpreter

	A.	See the Gnuifier.8.cs or higher changeset in the specialChangeSetsFolder
	B.	DoIt: 	(Gnuifier on: pathToInterpreterfile) gnuify, in my case:

		(Gnuifier on:
			((FileDirectory default
				directoryNamed: 'src')  "Perhaps src32 depending on how VMMaker 32/64 thinks about this"
				directoryNamed: 'vm') pathName) gnuify
	C. 	Note that if the src folder is called src32, you will need to rename it to src in order for xcode to find it.


Step Five: Shove and Tweak some files around the buildspace

	A.	Open a MacOSX Finder browser and go to the platforms/Mac OS/vm/Developer folder.
	B.	Unzip 'resources.zip' by double-clicking on it. Put the resulting resource folder in the folder containing
		the 'platforms' and 'src' folders.
	C.	Unstuff 'SqueakVMUNIXPATHS.xcodeproj.zip' (same deal as step B)
	D.	Drag 'SqueakVMUNIXPATHS.xcodeproj' to the folder containing
		the 'platforms' and 'src' folders.

	E.	Ensure a copy of the file (again found in the Developer directory):
			Squeak VM Universal-Info.plist
		can be found in the folder containing the 'platforms' and 'src' folders.

Step Six: Run ProjectBuilder and build yourself an interpreter {for xcode 1.5 or higher }

	A.	Double-click the SqueakVMUNIXPATHS.xcodeproj file
	B.	On the left pane, see the SqueakVMUNIXPATHS blue xcode icon.
		Click on  it to see the files.
		Files which can't be found are listed in red. For any red highlighted files you'll need to 
		resolve where or why the files is/are missing.
	c.	On the left pane, find the Targets icon. 
	d.	Select "Squeak VM Opt"
	e.	From the Project menu pick the active build configuration you want to use.
		Click on the hammer icon at the top  to build your VM.


		Problems: 
		1) It is possible depending on which updated SDK from apple that you have that you might get an error 
		in obj-class.h  parsing @class Protocol;   That is an error in Apple's source code. 

		You must then use sudo vi {path to the file}/obj-class.h to edit the read ony system file and 
		alter the @class Protocol to 

		#ifdef __OBJC__
			@class Protocol;
		#else
			typedef struct objc_object Protocol;
		#endif

		2) Corrections to 10.3.9 SDKs api for IOHIDLib.h. If you build with the 10.2.8SDK this file is not a problem. If you build with the 10.4U SDK this is not a problem. But if you build with the default 10.3.9 SDK then you get a redefinition of IOHIDQueueInterface and IOHIDOutputTransactionInterface error. To fix this you must change your 10.3.9 SDK version of IOHIDLib.h based on changes in the 10.4u SDK. 

		in the 10.4u SDK api's it's 

struct IOHIDQueueInterface
{
IUNKNOWN_C_GUTS;
IOHIDQUEUEINTERFACE_FUNCS_100;
};

and

struct IOHIDOutputTransactionInterface
{
IUNKNOWN_C_GUTS;
IOHIDOUTPUTTRANSACTIONINTERFACE_FUNCS_120;
};


		3) We use a sqNamedPrims.h in the Mac OS source tree, versus the sqNamedPrims.h that is created in the src
		directory. You may need to repoint the xcode source file to point to your sqNamedPrims.h if the internal plugins built are 
		different. 

		4) All this work only builds the VM, external plugins such as the mpeg plugin or services, speilling or quicktime can then 
		be copied over from a distributed production VM if required. 

		5) The final product should live in the build folder, a subfolder depending on build configuration and, and 
		the bundle is named "Squeak VM Opt"
		Compare VM against the offical build to see if it is the same. 
		Note you should look at the binary in the Contents subfolder to see if it is the same size.
		Run a tinyBenchmark benchmark against your VM, versus the production VM to confirm yours is simular in performance.

Step Seven: Download and print your Squeak VM Developer's Certificate

Congratulations! Take a bow!

Browser plugin {new version}

In the fall of 2006, Viewpoints Research Inc provided funding to rewrite the Browser plugin 
using the unix model of small plugin launching headless VM. This XCode project is in the 
Mac OS/vm/npsqueak  directory.  The plugin must interact with a 3.8.16b5 or later Macintosh VM
because of the tight integration of the drawing logic. 

Browser plugin {old version} 

I believe you must check out the SVN tree at #1327. This predates the MacIntel work 
which made the NPSqueak logic obsolete, you might need an early version, email if issues. 

It's now possible to build a browser plugin without much work. To do this just 
pick the NPSqueak target, and in the Targets tab pick either Safari or IE as the 
targeted browser. Remember to copy the newly compiled NPSqueak.bundle to the Internet Plug-ins Folder
so you debug the right bundle.

--------------------------------------------
yes yes, rewrite someday, please ignore all below, sorry
{Mostly broken below, changes pending}

Building with PrintJobPlugin as internal

Add to the build as internal plugin list
do a "clean out"
do a "Generate all"

This should result in a folder being created 
src/vm/intplugins/PrintJobPlugin
and of course we also use the code in 
platforms/Mac OS/plugins/PrintJobPlugin folder

Returning to the project builder project we need to add a number of files to the project.

In the "Files" tab view 
Select down to the location we want to put the built source
Sources/src/plugins/vm/intplugins
Create a new group called PrintJobPlugin
Add the file PrintJobPlugin.c  from src/vm/intplugins/PrintJobPlugin to that group

Do the same type of work to select the other files need to build the plugin
PrintJobPlugin.h file from the platforms/Cross/plugins/PrintJobPlugin folder
that should go in the Sources/Cross/plugins/PrintJobPlugin group that you will create
sqMacPrinting.c & sqMacPrinting.h from the platforms/Mac OS/plugins/PrintJobPlugin
these should go in the Sources/Mac OS/plugins/PrintJobPlugin group that you will create


See the following for information on the older harder way, which you can now ignore.

---------------------------------------------------

Older Notes (Below)

The platform specific files are sqMacXXX.c, totaling about  more than 2000 lines of code
when this document was originally written. All other code is written to standard
ANSI libraries and should port easily to other C environments.

The files interp.c, sqSoundPrims.c, sqMiscPrims.c, and others are generated
automatically, so changes to these files will be lost when they are next
generated. It is fine to make ephemeral changes to these file for the purpose of
debugging or statistics gathering. 

The current VM was compiled with Metrowerks CodeWarrior Pro 5.3. Earlier versions of Squeak used
the Symantec Think C 6.0, but there were a few bugs in their libraries having to do
with 8-byte versus 4-byte integers. These bugs have probably been fixed by now.

This code has also been compiled under the MPW "Mr. C" Macintosh compiler by
Hans-Martin Mosner (hmm@heeg.de) with only one minor change: you will need to
create an empty "MacHeaders.h" file. You may get some harmless compiler warnings
and, for peak performance, the method that patches the dispatch loop must also be
changed. Hans-Martin says: "The whole VM seems to be marginally slower than the
delivered VM, but it is significantly smaller." Note that Jitter 3 (Squeak V3.x) has migrated
to Gnu GCC, and MPW. As of late fall 2000 there is no 68K version, but the macintosh
specific source is the same with additional files for Jitter 3.

The source code also has been compiled with Apple's project builder under OS-X, but we are 
not shipping an example of it at this time.

To build using CW we have provided an XML exported CW project that should match the 
current one being used to build the production VM.  There is also a project file for the MPEG3 Plugin,
the TestOSAPlugin (AppleScript), and SqueakFFIPrims (Foreign Function Calls). You must import
these project XML files into CW to build the projects.  Other XML project files are included as
an example.

To get an additional speedup, the object code for the bytecode dispatch loop of
the PPC version can be patched using the method "patchInterp:" in Interpreter
class.

Also you might need to add 	struct foo *foo = &fum;
to interpret()

68K Notes

Note: In order to support dynamically loaded primitives, we have switched to
using Code Fragement Manager model for the 68K VM. This has several
ramifications:

  1. You now need to use the CFM versions of the library files. The 68K project
file has been updated accordingly.
  2. You cannot run the 68K VM under the emulator on the PowerPC (Apple doesn't
support CFM apps under the 68K emulator).
  3. You need to be sure that version 4.0 or later of "CFM-68K Runtime Enabler"
is in the Extensions folder of the system folder on your 68K Mac. *** Warning:
Older versions of "CFM-68K Runtime Enabler" had bugs that will probably prevent
Squeak from even starting! ***.

The shipping 68K version of Squeak uses the older MacTCP interface. You can alter
the sqMacNetwork.c file and compile your own 68K verion of Squeak that uses the
new Open Transport version, but the availability of the 68K version of Open
Transport V1.3 is limited to 68040 machines that run system 8.1. You can run this
configuration on a 68030 using system 7.5.x but Apple does not support that
configuration.

Note with some work you can migrate back to a pure 68K application, versus a CFM 
environment if you wish for building regular 68k applications. 

Carbon

Much of the work to make a Carbon application is done, however we are still missing
a serialMidi interface and tablet support which are Carbon compliant. 

Pluginized VM

Squeak 2.8 and higher introduces the "pluginized VM". To reduce complexity 
most of the plugins are linked iternally into the VM. That is because many of them
still access a few VM functions and variables directly, rather than calling
through the interpreter proxy, which they must in order to run in an external
plugin. One can still override these builtin primitives with an external plugin
and, of course, newly built plugins can be created as external or internal
plugins, using the features of VMMaker. However you will need to mange your CW
project on your own. 

Building Squeak as a Browser Plugin

The plugin works with versions 4.0 or later of either browser. However,
the primitives that can be used to ask the browser to fetch a URL do not work in
versions of IE earlier than 5.0. 

The installation and use of Squeak as a browser plugin is somewhat beyond the
scope of this readme file. The basic idea is that the Squeak image started by the
browser lives in a pre-defined directory ("System
Folder:Preferences:Squeak:Internet" by default) with predefined name (e.g.,
"squeakPlugin.image"). The browser plugin can only read and write files within the
Internet directory and directories contained within it. This is called Squeak
file system "sand box". The browser captures most of the command key combination,
so you have to use the menus rather than your favorite Squeak command key
shortcuts. {Note that using the full screen option allows you to again use the
command key combinations and has better performance characteristics.} The browser
also captures cmd-., so the interrupt key when running under the browser is
control-C. The most flexible way to invoke Squeak is through the HTML "EMBED"
command. This allows arbitrary arguments to be made available to Squeak. The
"memory" EMBED tag can be used to tell Squeak how much memory is required by a
given Squeaklet.

To build a browser plugin VM, invoke the following command after building a regular VM.

 (MacOSPowerPCOS9BrowserVMMaker new initialize initializeAllInternalBut: #(IntegerPokerPlugin Mpeg3Plugin FFIPlugin TestOSAPlugin)) generateInterpreterFile.

Rename the interp.c file to pluginInterp.c. Then change the two definitions of 
PLUGIN found in sqMacWindow.c and platform.exports, and build your application. 
Squeak as a plugin will run as a Carbon plugin for Carbonized IE if you put it into the 
correct directory. 

If you build your own project file, note that IE requires that the main entry
point be "main" rather than CW's usual "__start". (Netscape doesn't care, so it
took me a long time to figure out why it wasn't working under IE!) The supplied
project produces a PPC-only plugin.


Porting Notes:

The file sqMacMinimal.c can be used a porting guide. This ~1100 line file stubs
out all non-essential support functions and, together with sqFilePrims.c, allows
one to build a functioning virtual machine that only lacks non-essential I/O
functions (including support for file directory enumeration, which is not really
essential!). The small size of this file demonstrates how little code is really
needed to get Squeak running on a new platform.

Thanks to Ian Piumarta, the C header files are identical across all the major
Squeak platforms.

The code assumes that C ints and pointers are 4 bytes and double floats are 8
bytes; these assumptions are checked at start up time. Float objects in the image
are stored in the IEEE standard byte ordering for double-precision floats on all
platforms; macros in sq.h can be defined to swap bytes into and out of the
platform native float format if necessary. (To ensure proper word alignment, one
typically has to copy a Squeak Float object into a C "double" variable before
operating on it; byte swapping can be done while doing this copy for little or no
additional cost.)
