The true source code for Squeak is generated from Squeak itself.
However, for convenience, the squeak-vm source package includes those
portions of the code already generated.  Details on the process are at:

    http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak/2173

After following the instructions on that page -- setting all plugins
to "internal" -- the "src" directory was renamed and tar-ed.
