VMMaker-3.7b5-unsignedFixes3-nk.2.cs

    Contains Ned Konz's last-minute fixes for the generated sources
    that avoid problems with loading image segments, the SqueakMap
    package list, etc.  They apply to the 3.7-5898-full image.

OSProcessPluginV3-3.sar
XDisplayControlPluginV1-0.sar
AioPluginV1-1.sar

    The latest OSProcessPlugin from Dave Lewis.  Not part of the
    standard VM distributions, but bundled with the Unix distribution
    for your convenience.

GLXUnix-ikp.2.cs

    Contains GLX support (as required by Croquet) that takes into
    account the differences between big- and little-endian machines.
    File this into a Croquet0.01 image before trying to run it on
    Unix.  (If you don't know what Croquet is then you don't need this
    file.)
