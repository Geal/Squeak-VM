/* Default sqPlatformSpecific.h -- Platform-specific prototypes and definitions */

/* How to use this file:
   This file is for general platform-specific macros and declarations.
   The goal is to keep most of the other header files generic across platforms.
   To override a definition or macro from sq.h, you must first #undef it, then
   provide the new definition.

   The default is no definitions. See platform specific directories for other versions of this file
