This page describes the steps necessary to build a Squeak VM on Windows.

<p><table bgcolor="#bdd3bd" width="100%">
  <tr><td cellvalign="center" align="center">
        <font size="+1" color="#639e9c"><b>Tool Setup</b></font></td></tr></table><p>

Download the <a href="release/Squeak-Win32-Tools-1.2.zip">
Squeak-Win32-Tools</a> package. This package contains the entire too chain 
that I am using to compile Squeak for Win32. It is provided as REFERENCE 
so that you don't have to dig the entire web for exactly this version of 
(for instance) the MINGW headers and libs or where to find the headers and
libs for DirectX (etc etc etc).The package contains:
<ul>
    <li> GNU binutils
    <li> gawk-3.0.3
    <li> make-3.77
    <li> mingw-crtdll
    <li> gcc-2.95.2-1
    <li> DirectX7 
</ul>


To install the package, extract everything you have into C:\ (make sure 
the directory structure stays intact) or to another convenient place 
(I strongly recommend putting everything into C:\ as this will avoid 
needless changes further down the road).<p>
Add "C:\GNUTools\bin" to your PATH environment variable in  autoexec.bat 
by going to the control panel, open the "system" panel, click on the 
"Advanced" tab, and on the "Environment variables" button. You can change 
the PATH environment variable from there.<p>

Grab the Squeak-Win32 source release from the <a href="release">release 
directory</a>. Source releases are packaged for easy recompilation and plugin 
development - using the SVN sources directly runs the risk of it not being
in sync with some of the latest modifications in other areas.<p>


If you want to do some of your own development you may instead 
check out the platform tree from SqueakVM.org via<p>
<pre>
  svn co http://squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/trunk platforms
</pre>
and work from there. If you do this be advised of the following<p>

<b>WARNING</b>: Working from the HEAD of the SVN repository 
will almost certainly require additional work. That's because the VM 
maintainers work at different schedules and one maintainer's modification 
at HEAD may break another VM. If you want to make sure the VM compiles 
out of the box, <b>USE A FILE RELEASE</b>.

<p><table bgcolor="#bdd3bd" width="100%">
  <tr><td cellvalign="center" align="center">
        <font size="+1" color="#639e9c"><b>Regenerating the Source</b></font></td></tr></table><p>

To regenerate the entire VM you will have to get aquainted to 
<a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2105">VMMaker</a> and 
<a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/2444">VMMakerTool</a>.<p>

If you just want to rebuild the VM use the build location provided by the
file release you are using. If you do your own development you need to decide
where to put the build files. You have two choices:<p>
<ol>
<li>Use the platforms/win32/build directory. The advantage is that the location
is what is being used by the Makefiles and will work out of the box. The 
disadvantage is that this directory is backed by the squeakvm.org repository
(as is the entire path) and may be problematic if you need to maintain your
own repository.<p>
<li> Use your own build directory outside of the platforms tree. This is the
approach that is used for all of the release builds, simply because it makes 
a clear separation between the (static) platforms tree and the generated
and build tree. To set this up you should:<p>
<ul>
<li> Copy the contents of platforms/win32/build to your build location
<li> Adjust PLATDIR in build/Makefile to point to the platforms directory
(see one of the win32 release builds for an example)
</ul>
</ol>
<p>

Once you have decided to set up your build environment, open VMMaker from
the world menu and provide it with  the path to the platforms 
code. Assuming you've put the platforms tree into C:\SqueakVM\ this would be 
C:\SqueakVM\platforms. You also need to provide the path to the generated 
sources, which should be the src directory inside your build directory, e.g.,
either
<pre>
  C:\SqueakVM\platforms\win32\build\src (default build location)
  C:\SqueakVM\mybuild\src (custom build location in C:\SqueakVM\mybuild)
</pre>
<b>NOTE</b>: If you can't seem to change the path to the generated sources,
make sure you've got the right version of Win32VMMaker.<p>

Next, customize VMMaker for the plugins you'd like to have internal vs.
external. Generally, the release builds have "everything builtin" except 
from the FFI plugin (SqueakFFIPrims). Some plugins (as of this time of writing
FileCopyPlugin, InternetConfigPlugin, MacMenuBarPlugin, and TestOSAPlugin)
cannot be built on Windows. If you have a large number of plugins that can't
be made either internal or external, your paths are most likely incorrect.<p>

Finally, generate the entire sources for the build.<p>

<p><table bgcolor="#bdd3bd" width="100%">
  <tr><td cellvalign="center" align="center">
        <font size="+1" color="#639e9c"><b>Sanity Check</b></font></td></tr></table><p>
Make sure you have a sane build setup before going on. Your directories
should look roughly like this (assuming C:\SqueakVM\ is the root of the 
installation):<p>
<pre>
C:\SqueakVM\platforms - the platform tree originating from squeakvm.org
C:\SqueakVM\platforms\Cross - the cross platform files (required)
C:\SqueakVM\platforms\win32 - the win32 platform files (required)

C:\SqueakVM\mybuild - the build tree (may differ if you use another location)
C:\SqueakVM\mybuild\src - the place for generated sources
C:\SqueakVM\mybuild\vm - the core vm sources
C:\SqueakVM\mybuild\XYZPlugin - the sources for XYZPlugin
</pre>

<p><table bgcolor="#bdd3bd" width="100%">
  <tr><td cellvalign="center" align="center">
        <font size="+1" color="#639e9c"><b>Customization</b></font></td></tr></table><p>

If you need a custom VM, the build process is also a great place to add a few
customizations.<p>

To change the <b>name</b> of the VM edit the Makefile (in your build directory)
and change the VM definition to, e.g.,
<pre>
  VM = MyCustomVM
</pre>
This will change various VM related settings to use your name, including
titles for quit messages etc. It will also require you to provide a 
MyCustomVM.rc file which you can use to provide custom icons and other 
resources. Have a look at Squeak.rc and Croquet.rc to see examples.

  <tr><td cellvalign="center" align="center">
        <font size="+1" color="#639e9c"><b>Compiling</b></font></td></tr></table><p>

After following the above steps, cd into the build directory and invoke make.
If you've followed the above instructions, you should be rewarded with a
brand new VM.
