Building Unix Squeak
--------------------

Full documentation can be found in:

   platforms/unix/doc/HowToBuildFromSource.{txt,html,ps,pdf}

For the impatient:

1. Type 'make' in the directory containing this file (the one you are
   reading right now).

2. Install the VM, plugins, man pages and documentation:

	sudo make install

3. If you haven't used Squeak before, RTFM:

	man squeak

4. Enjoy!

Note: The latest documentation and releases are available from:
