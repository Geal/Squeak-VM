Description: The Squeak Smalltalk System (virtual machine)
 Squeak is an open, highly-portable Smalltalk-80 implementation whose 
 virtual machine is written entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to 
 debug, analyze, and change. To achieve practical performance, a 
 translator produces an equivalent C program whose performance is 
 comparable to commercial Smalltalks.
 .
 This package contains the virtual machine (VM) for Squeak.  It is
 compiled to use the Network Audio System (NAS) to play and record
 sound.
