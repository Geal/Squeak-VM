Help for Squeak
===============

What is this?
-------------
This is the Acorn port of Squeak 3.2, a public domain Smalltalk system.
Updates, patches etc are available from http://sumeru.stanford.edu/tim as and when I can make time to produce then. 

What is Smalltalk?
------------------
Smalltalk is the original object oriented programming language and environment from which most OSs have learnt about windowing, pixel displays, menus and so on. You will need to read about Smalltalk to make best use of it, since it is likely to be quite unfamiliar to you at first.

Be warned, the user interface is not quite like RiscOS; in particular:-
a) the right hand mouse button is NOT used as 'adjust', but to open a menu to operate on the window currently active; thus serving many of the functions of the window icons under RiscOS
b) the menus make the choice when you _release_ the menu button over an item. So, press the menu button and hold it down whilst you make your choice.
c) as you will quickly notice, the Squeak windows can exist only within the single big RiscOS window. This may change later.

Information
-----------
For those with web access, there is plenty of information available about Squeak and all the other variants of Smalltalk. See http://www.squeak.org/, the Squeak.Org main site for updates, releases, goodies etc and perhaps most important, the squeak mailing list. You may get yourself onto the list by sending email to:

Known problems with this release
================================

File naming is a problem. Squeak is ported to many machines and far too many people make bad assumptions about the permissable form of file names. RiscOS is the only popular OS to have problems with long filenames, '.' used for filename extensions etc. This shouldn't be a problem in an object oriented system, since we should be able to catch bad behaviour and correct the file names, but there are many places currently in the system where something like  'fred the great.text' is used as a filename.
To get around this problem, I have made Squeak accept Unix style filenames, ie use a '/' as the directory separator and '.' for filename extensions. This is a minor inconvenience in that you have to remember the change from normal RiscOS practice, but we are  all getting used to URLs anyway, so it should not be too painful. It does at least save most of the filename troubles with Squeak code.

File opening can be a problem. RiscOS's basic filing system only lets us open files once, whereas most other systems at least let you open a file once for writing and many extra times for read only. This is used for quite a few things in the current system and so several useful facilities just won't work . I have had considerable success in using Richard Atterer's !raFS filing system to allow both long filenames and multiple openings. Go to <http://home.augsburg.baynet.de/richard.atterer/e/> to download it.

No iconbar menu yet.

No clipboard integration - you can't cut/copy/paste from/to Squeak. Progress is being made towards this.

Hotkeys don't work quite like in RiscOS. Again, since Squeak was first created on a Mac, it is rather biased towards the Mac keyboard layout and shortcuts. Mac's have both a 'cmd' key and a 'ctl' key (and the 'option' key of course but don't worry about that for now) and RPCs have 'ct' and 'alt' keys. Sadly, we can't map one to the other in a simple way since there are no keypress events generated for most alt-keys. So to get around this I have separated out the left and right ctl keys.  The LEFT one is used for 'ctl' (think controL) and the RIGHT for 'cmd' (think commanD => dexter => right). There are still some confusions beyond this in that there are shift-cmd hotkeys available in Squeak, but the ctl key can be usd to access them as well.
There is a help window that describes the available hotkeys (use the screen menu, choose 'help...' then 'command key help') that should give you some assistance in understanding things. The ctl-<, ctl-= and cmd-shift-+ actions don't work because RiscOS doesn't generate keypress event for those keys.

Sound is not hooked up yet.

Serial ports neither. Nor MIDI. Bummer.
