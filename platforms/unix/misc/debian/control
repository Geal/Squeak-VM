Description: The Squeak Smalltalk System (Virtual Machine)
 This is the VM for Squeak. 
 .
 Squeak is an open, highly-portable Smalltalk-80 implementation whose 
 virtual machine is written entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to 
 debug, analyze, and change. To achieve practical performance, a 
 translator produces an equivalent C program whose performance is 
 comparable to commercial Smalltalks.
 .
 This binary uses the Network Audio System to play and record sound.
