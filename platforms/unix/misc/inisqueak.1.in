.SH NAME
inisqueak \- Squeak installer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B inisqueak
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B inisqueak
automates the setup and execution of Squeak for a new user.
It checks that the local Squeak installation appears sane, 
copies an image and changes file to the current directory,
makes a symbolic link to the sources file, and finally, if
all went well, runs
.B squeak
itself.

.PP
After
.B inisqueak
has been run once in a directory, it is possible to run
.B squeak
directly; however, it is also safe to continue running it indirectly
via
.B inisqueak.

.PP
.SH INVOCATION
.B inisqueak
has no options or arguments.
Simply \`cd\' to a working directory  and  run it.


.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B inisqueak 
prints several informational messages while doing its stuff.  Its
messages should be self-explanatory.


.SH FILES
.I {sqdatadir}/SqueakV{major}.sources
.RS
Shared system sources file for the Squeak image.
.B inisqueak
will create a symbolic link to this file from the current directory.
.RE
.sp
.I {sqdatadir}/squeak.image
.I {sqdatadir}/squeak.changes
.RS
Distributed image and changes files holding a `shapshot' of a
live Squeak session.
.B inisqueak
will copy these files to the current directory, so that the
user may make personal changes to them.
