Building Unix Squeak
--------------------

Full documentation can be found in:

   platforms/unix/doc/HowToBuildFromSource.{txt,html,ps,pdf}

For the impatient:

1. Change to the 'platforms/unix' directory (if you aren't already
   there) and type 'make' to build the VM and plugins:

        cd platforms/unix
        make

2. Install the VM, plugins, man pages and documentation (as root,
   note the 'sudo' command to gain superuser privileges):

	sudo make install

3. If you haven't used Squeak before, read the manual:

	man squeak

4. Enjoy!

Note: The latest documentation and releases are available from:
