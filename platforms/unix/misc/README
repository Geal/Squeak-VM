GLXUnix-ikp.2.cs -

    Contains GLX support (as required by Croquet) that takes into
    account the differences between big- and little-endian machines.
    File this into a Croquet0.01 image before trying to run it on
    Unix.  (If you don't know what Croquet is then you don't need this
    file.)
